        I&apos;ve been trying to recognize musical notes by ear using popular
        methods of interval recognition and numerous ear training apps.
        <br />
        Despite my discipline to practice every day, I did not notice any
        significant progress

        training ...

        this method more comfortably, no need to have or to know how to play an
        instrument
